# Timed Coding Quiz with Multiple-Choice Questions

This project involves building a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. The application will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. The goal is to provide a clean, polished, and responsive user interface that allows users to test their knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals while storing high scores for later comparison with their peers.

## User Story
- AS A coding boot camp student
- I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
- SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers


## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
- WHEN I click the start button
- HEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
- WHEN I answer a question
- THEN I am presented with another question
- WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
- THEN time is subtracted from the clock
- WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
- THEN the game is over
- WHEN the game is over
- THEN I can save my initials and score


## Approach
To build this application, I approached the project in the following steps:

-  Created the basic HTML structure for the quiz, including a header, question area, answer buttons, and a timer display.
- Used CSS to style the quiz and make it responsive on different screen sizes.
- Wrote JavaScript code to populate the quiz with questions and multiple-choice answers.
- Implemented logic to check whether a user's answer is correct or incorrect and adjust the timer accordingly.
- Stored the user's score and initials in local storage and displayed the high scores on a separate page.


## Completed tasks
- Set up the basic HTML structure for the quiz
- Styled the quiz using CSS
- Wrote JavaScript code to populate the quiz with questions and multiple-choice answers
- Implemented logic to check whether a user's answer is correct or incorrect and adjust the timer accordingly
- Stored the user's score and initials in local storage 
- Created a separate page to display the high scores

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project challenged me to use my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. Through this project, I was able to hone my skills in front-end web development and gain experience in working with local storage and dynamic HTML and CSS. Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience and helped me to better understand what it takes to create a polished and responsive user interface for web applications.
